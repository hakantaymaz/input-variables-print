# we will create a game of rock, paper, scissors

# First, user will shoot rock, paper or scissors, then the computer will select randomly
# one of rock, paper or scissors.
# Then, we will print out results based on the selections.


# starting with downloading the random module which will let us use the randint() function

import random

# Then, we will ask the user to select Rock:r, Paper: p or Scissors: s

user = input("Enter (r for Rock, p for Paper or s for Scissors): ")


# Then, we will ask the computer select a random number from numbers 1, 2 and 3.

random_number = random.randint(1,3)

# Then, we will assign letters r, p or s to a variable called "computer" depending on the
# random number created by the function randit(1,3). If our number is 1, computer variable
# will be "r" and so on..

if random_number == 1:
    computer = "r"
elif random_number == 2:
    computer = "p"
else:
    computer = "s"
    
# Then, we will print the sentence below using both strings and variables user and computer.

print ("You chose", user, "and computer chose", computer)

# Then, we will use conditionals to decide and print who won the game.

if user == computer:
    print("Play again!")
elif user == "r" and computer == "p":
    print("Paper beats Rock, You LOST!")
elif user == "p" and computer == "s":
    print("Scissors beat Paper, You LOST!")
elif user == "s" and computer == "r":
    print("Rock beats Scissors, You LOST!")
elif user == "r" and computer == "s":
    print("Rock beats Scissors, You WIN!")
elif user == "p" and computer == "r":
