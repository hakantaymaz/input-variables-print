# First, ask the user to enter a number which will be stored in a variable we call "a".

a = int(input("enter a number: "))

# Here we use an if statement and we have two conditions;
# 1. if the number the user entered is greater than 5 and at the same time it is
# less than 10. If these two conditions together are met, then we say print out
#"a is less than 4". Otherwise (we use else), we want it to print out "BS"
# Please pay attention that the statement we print doesn't need to be true, we can
# print whatever we want if the conditions are met or else..

if a > 5 and a < 10:
    print("a is less than 4")
    
else:
    print("BS")
