# We first ask the user to enter three integer numbers, and we assign those numbers
# to variables called a, b and c (user doesn't know what we call them, it is for us to
# to be able to continue with our program).

a = int(input("First Integer:" ))
b = int(input("Second Integer:" ))
c = int(input("Third Integer:" ))

# Here, we are creating an if statement(conditional) using our variables a, b and c.
# What we ask for it to do is pretty obvious. One thing really important is we use "or"
# operator which means "if any of these are true", then print out "sum of two".
# Second important thing is as you see we didn't use "else". We can simply do that
# and it simply means do nothing if our statements are not true.

if a+b==c or b+c==a or a+c==b:
    print('sum of two')
    
if a*b==c or b*c==a or a*c==b:
    print('product of two')
