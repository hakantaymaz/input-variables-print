# ask the user to enter two numbers
# the code below means when the user enter those numbers, they will be stored
# in variables called "a" and "b".

a = int(input("enter number 1: "))
b = int(input("enter number 2: "))

# Here we are writing an if statement (condition).
# What we say here is if the remainder (a%b) when we do the operation a/b equals 0,
# then, print out the word "divisible" on the screen. If not (else), print out
#"not divisible" on the screen.

if a%b is 0:
    print('divisible')
else:
    print('not divisible')
